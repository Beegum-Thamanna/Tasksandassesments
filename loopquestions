You are creating a program that calculates a student's letter grade based on their numerical grade. If a student's numerical grade is between 90 and 100, they receive an A. If their grade is between 80 and 89, they receive a B. If their grade is between 70 and 79, they receive a C. If their grade is between 60 and 69, they receive a D. If their grade is below 60, they receive an F. Write a Ruby program that takes a student's numerical grade as input and outputs their letter grade. 

You are creating a program that determines if a number is positive, negative, or zero. Write a Ruby program that takes a number as input and outputs whether it is positive, negative, or zero. 

You are creating a program that determines if a person is eligible to vote in a particular election. In order to vote, a person must be at least 18 years old and a citizen of the country in which the election is taking place. Write a Ruby program that takes a person's age and citizenship status as input and outputs whether they are eligible to vote 

You are creating a program that calculates the discount for a customer's purchase. If a customer spends over $100, they receive a 10% discount. If they spend over $50 but less than or equal to $100, they receive a 5% discount. If they spend less than or equal to $50, they do not receive a discount. Write a Ruby program that takes the customer's purchase amount as input and outputs their discount amount. 

You are creating a program that calculates the total cost of a customer's order. The cost of an item is $10. If a customer orders 10 or more items, they receive a 10% discount on their entire order. Write a Ruby program that takes the number of items the customer is ordering as input and outputs their total cost. 

You are creating a program that checks if a given year is a leap year. A year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4, except for years that are divisible by 100 but not by 400. Write a Ruby program that takes a year as input and outputs whether it is a leap year or not. 

You are creating a program that checks if a given word is a palindrome. A palindrome is a word that is spelled the same way forwards and backwards. For example, "racecar" is a palindrome. Write a Ruby program that takes a word as input, checks if it is a palindrome, and outputs the result. 

You are creating a program that calculates the factorial of a given number. The factorial of a number is the product of all positive integers up to and including that number. For example, the factorial of 5 is 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120. Write a Ruby program that takes a number as input, calculates its factorial, and outputs the result. 

9. A restaurant has a list of menu items and their prices. The restaurant owner wants to print the menu to the console, along with the price of each item, and then calculate the total cost of a customer's order. Write a Ruby program to solve this problem.
