QUESTION â€“ ARRAYS AND HASHES 

 

1.  Given an array of integers, write a Ruby program to return the sum of all the even numbers in the array. 

 

Example: 

Input: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] 

Output: 12 (sum of even numbers 2, 4, and 6) 

 

2. Given an array of integers, write a method to return a new array with all the odd numbers removed. 

 

3. Given an array of strings, write a method to return a new array containing only the strings that contain the letter 'a'. 

 

4. Given an array of integers, write a method to return a new array with the elements in reverse order. 

 

5.  Given an array of strings, write a method to return a new array containing only the strings with a length between 4 and 8 (inclusive). 

 

6. A teacher wants to calculate the average grade for a class of students. The grades are stored in an array of integers. However, the teacher wants to exclude the lowest grade and the highest grade from the calculation, as they may not be representative of the overall performance. 

grades = [88, 92, 78, 85, 90, 82, 75, 95] 

Hash Questions 

 

7. A company wants to track the number of sales made by each of its salespeople. The sales data is stored in an array of hashes, where each hash contains the name of the salesperson and the number of sales made. The company wants to find out who made the most sales and how many sales they made. 

Initialize - 

 sales_data = [ 

  { name: "Alice", sales: 10 }, 

  { name: "Bob", sales: 20 }, 

  { name: "Charlie", sales: 15 }, 

  { name: "Dave", sales: 25 } 

] 

Output  :- Dave made the most sales with 25 sales. 

 

8. A music festival wants to keep track of the number of people attending each of its stages. The attendance data is stored in an array of arrays, where each inner array contains the name of the stage and the number of people attending. The festival wants to find out which stage had the highest attendance and how many people attended that stage. 

Initialize - 

attendance_data = [ 

  ["Main Stage", 5000], 

  ["Rock Stage", 3000], 

  ["Dance Stage", 7000], 

  ["Acoustic Stage", 2000] 

] 

 

Output required - Dance Stage had the highest attendance with 7000 people. 

 

9. A company wants to keep track of the number of hours worked by each of its employees. The employee data is stored in a hash, where each key is the employee name and the value is the number of hours worked. The company wants to find out the total number of hours worked by all employees. 

 

Initial -  

employee_data = { 

  "Alice" => 40, 

  "Bob" => 30, 

  "Charlie" => 45, 

  "Dave" => 35 

} 

Output :- The total number of hours worked by all employees is 150. 

 

10. Alice is collecting data on the ages of the members of her local book club. She has created an array called ages that contains the following values: [28, 35, 42, 51, 39, 44, 32, 48, 29, 36]. Alice wants to find the average age of the members of her book club. What is the average age of the book club members? 

 

Output - : The average age of the book club members is  

 

11. You have a list of usernames and passwords stored in a hash in your Ruby program. You need to create a login function that accepts a username and password as parameters and checks if they match the values in the hash. If the username and password are valid, the function should return "Login Successful". Otherwise, it should return "Invalid username or password". 

users = { 

  "user1" => "pass1", 

  "user2" => "pass2", 

  "user3" => "pass3" 

} 

 

12. You need to keep track of the number of occurrences of each letter in a given string. Create a function that accepts a string and returns a hash where the keys are the unique letters in the string and the values are the number of occurrences of each letter. 

 

Output examples :-  

 

letter_count("hello world") #=> {"h"=>1, "e"=>1, "l"=>3, "o"=>2, " "=>1, "w"=>1, "r"=>1, "d"=>1} 

letter_count("abracadabra") #=> {"a"=>5, "b"=>2, "r"=>2, "c"=>1, "d"=>1}
