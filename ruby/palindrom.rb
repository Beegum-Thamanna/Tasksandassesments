# You are creating a program that checks if a given word is a palindrome.
# A palindrome is a word that is spelled the same way forwards and backwards.
# For example, "racecar" is a palindrome. Write a Ruby program that takes a word as input, 
# checks if it is a palindrome, and outputs the result.
